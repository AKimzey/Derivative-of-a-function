# Derivative-of-a-function
Use MATLAB to find the graph of the derivative of the function
- Set up an x-array from 0 to 10 with an increment of 0.01
- Calculate the y-array that matches that x-array
- Find the central difference estimate of the derivative
- Plot the original function and the derivative on two separate graphs
  - Include a grid, titles and axis labels
  - Set both x axes to run from 0 to 1
